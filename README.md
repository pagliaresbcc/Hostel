# HostelApp

  Computer Science final paper whose goal is to show the importance of software tests, applied in an application <br>
  that simulates a hostel reservation system. <br>
  The application was created using React for front-end, SpringBoot for back-end and MySQL for data storage. <br>
  To perform the tests was used JUnit for unity and integration tests and Selenium for end-to-end tests.
  
## Requeriments

    - `create database hostel;`
    - `create database teste;`
  
### Backend directory
  - You just need to open and configure the backend directory on your IDE (open as maven project, <br>
    download dependencies, etc) and run the application.
  
### Frontend directory
  - You need to execute `npm install` to install all of dependencies and then execute `npm start`.
